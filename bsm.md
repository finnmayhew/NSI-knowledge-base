# BSM

Physics beyond the Standard Model.

One observed BSM effect is non-zero neutrino masses, which is implied through a combination of the observation of [oscillation](oscillation.md) ([Fukuda-oscillation-1998](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1562)) and observations which rule out massless oscillation ([Smirnov-solar-2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02386.pdf)).

One way it may manifest is through [NSI](nsi.md).
