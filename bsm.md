# BSM

Physics beyond the Standard Model.

One observed BSM effect is non-zero neutrino masses, which is implied through a combination of the observation of [oscillation](oscillation.md) and observations which rule out massless oscillation ([Elisa-thesis-2023](https://seafile.rlp.net/f/f660b4d52dc04953bb36/)).

One way it may manifest is in [NSI](nsi.md).
