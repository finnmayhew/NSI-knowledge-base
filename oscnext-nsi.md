# OscNext NSI

An ongoing IceCube [NSI](nsi.md) analysis ([wiki](https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/OscNext_NSI)).

Follows the precedent of the [DRAGON NSI](dragon-nsi.md) analysis.

Performed by Elisa Lohfink.

Uses 8 years of [DeepCore](deepcore.md) data from 5.6 to 300 GeV ([source](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f57381a93408c0001d7bb10)).

[[PISA]] on its own cannot handle the NSI parameter space for a few reasons. [MCMC](mcmc.md) is used in place of minimization via [emcee](emcee.md). This will allow simultaneous evaluation of all NSI parameters ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).
