# Oscillation

The tendency for a neutrino produced in one flavor state to be detected in another.

Measured oscillations are a combination of vacuum oscillations and [matter effects](matter-effects.md) ([source](https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.072006)):

$$
\begin{align*}
    H_\nu(x) &= H_\text{vac} + H_\text{mat}(x)\\
    H_{\bar{\nu}}(x) &= \big(H_\text{vac} - H_\text{mat}(x)\big)^*
\end{align*}
$$
