# DRAGON NSI

A 2021 IceCube [NSI](nsi.md) analysis ([wiki](https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/All_flavour_non-standard_interactions)).

Performed by Thomas Ehrhardt.

Used 3 years of [DeepCore](deepcore.md) data from 5.6 to 100 GeV ([source](https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/All_flavour_non-standard_interactions)).

Performed in two parts ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)):

1. When testing for any of the five NSI parameters, assume all others are zero (results in model dependence, required computationally).
2. Use a different parameterization with three NSI parameters, allowing some limits to be placed on a fully free NSI hypothesis.

Succeeded by the [OscNext NSI](oscnext-nsi.md) analysis.
