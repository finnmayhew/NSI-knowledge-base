# My questions

- What does it mean that the approach of using five effective coupling parameters is "mostly" independent of the underlying model and mediator mass?
- Why can you subtract off $\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus \times \mathbf{1}$ to reduce the number of parameters from six to five?
- How can [DRAGON NSI](dragon-nsi.md) use neutrinos from all directions? Don't we have to look in the [oscillations](oscillation.md) region to see [matter effects](matter-effects.md)?
- What does "complete measurement of NSI and standard oscillation parameters has also been shown perturbatively to be impossible in counting analyses like the one in this work" (from Elisa's thesis) mean?
- Are there any BSM hypotheses that include NSI that allow for zero neutrino mass?
