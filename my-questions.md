# My questions

- Why can you subtract off $\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus \times \mathbf{1}$ to reduce the number of parameters from six to five?
  - Elisa: it's fundamental for oscillation, we're sensitive only to the differences in the diagonal elements
- What does it mean that the approach of using five effective coupling parameters is "mostly" independent of the underlying model and mediator mass? (see p. 34 in Elisa's thesis)
  - I answered this in my notes, check
- How can [DRAGON NSI](dragon-nsi.md) use neutrinos from all directions? Don't we have to look in the [oscillations](oscillation.md) region to see [matter effects](matter-effects.md)?
  - Elisa: this is an OscNext specific thing, there may be oscillations when looking up (the cut is for muon contamination / data/MC disagreement)
- What does "complete measurement of NSI and standard oscillation parameters has also been shown perturbatively to be impossible in counting analyses like the one in this work" (from Elisa's thesis) mean?
  - Elisa: Key point is that you can't perfectly do both a both NSI and oscillations analysis
- What is the effect of fitting only one parameter at a time? How do we interpret that additional model dependence?
  - Elisa: there are models that predict only single parameters — so we are in a way constraining those models — there is value in constraining entirely along the axes
  - Elisa: because the NSI parameters are orthogonal (or close to it), even if the true point in parameter space is not along an axis, you can still get sensitivity to the truth when you look along the axes — the only way that wouldn't be the case would be if the effects of the different parameters cancelled each other out
- How does the $\chi^2_\text{mod}$ work? Is this the only place priors enter, or do priors also influence MC generation?
- Now that the charm problem in GENIE has been discovered (Elisa 7.3.3), do we need the DIS CSMS nuisance parameter?
- How do we handle correlated parameters?
- What does "This method [(hypersurfaces)] operates on the bin counts expected at the null hypothesis and has been found to artificially introduce correlations between detector and physics effects" mean? (Elisa 7.4.3)
