# My questions

- What is forward scattering?
- What does it mean that the approach of using five effective coupling parameters is "mostly" independent of the underlying model and mediator mass?
- Why can you subtract off $\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus \times \mathbf{1}$ to reduce the number of parameters from six to five?
- How can [DRAGON NSI](dragon-nsi.md) use neutrinos from all directions? Don't we have to look in the [oscillations](oscillation.md) region to see [matter effects](matter-effects.md)?
