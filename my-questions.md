# My questions

- What is the circle plus in the [NSI](nsi.md) parameters?
- What is forward scattering?
- What does it mean that the approach of using five effective coupling parameters is "mostly" independent of the underlying model and mediator mass?
- Why can you subtract off $\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus \times \mathbf{1}$ to reduce the number of parameters from six to five?
- Sensitivities on the [OscNext NSI](oscnext-nsi.md) analysis don't look better than the [DRAGON NSI](dragon-nsi.md) results to me â€” what am I not seeing?
