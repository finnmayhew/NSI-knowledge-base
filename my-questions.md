# My questions

- Why can you subtract off $\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus \times \mathbf{1}$ to reduce the number of parameters from six to five?
  - Elisa: it's fundamental for oscillation, we're sensitive only to the differences in the diagonal elements
- What is the effect of fitting only one parameter at a time? How do we interpret that additional model dependence?
  - Elisa: there are models that predict only single parameters — so we are in a way constraining those models — there is value in constraining entirely along the axes
  - Elisa: because the NSI parameters are orthogonal (or close to it), even if the true point in parameter space is not along an axis, you can still get sensitivity to the truth when you look along the axes — the only way that wouldn't be the case would be if the effects of the different parameters cancelled each other out
- How does the $\chi^2_\text{mod}$ work? Is this the only place priors enter, or do priors also influence MC generation?
- Now that the charm problem in GENIE has been discovered (Elisa 7.3.3), do we need the DIS CSMS nuisance parameter?
- How do we handle correlated parameters?
- About hypersurfaces, what does "This method operates on the bin counts expected at the null hypothesis and has been found to artificially introduce correlations between detector and physics effects" mean? (Elisa 7.4.3)
