# NSI

Non-standard neutrino interactions.

One scenario of [BSM](bsm.md).

IceCube analyses of NSI are

- [OscNext NSI](oscnext-nsi.md)
- [DRAGON NSI](dragon-nsi.md)

There were also IceCube NSI analyses done in 2017 (IC), 2018 (DC), and 2020 (DC) ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).

Other experiments that have done NSI analyses are Super-K (2011), MINOS (2013), and COHERENT (2018) ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).

NSI manifests through NC forward scattering between neutrinos and charged fermions in the Earth, assuming a new heavy mediator particle ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).

The existence of NSI effects may resolve tensions in the standard [oscillation](oscillation.md) parameters ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).

Our approach parametrizes the effect of NSI on the matter potential through five effective coupling parameters: $\epsilon_{e\mu}^\oplus$, $\epsilon_{e\tau}^\oplus$, $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}^\oplus$, $\epsilon_{ee}^\oplus - \epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus$, $\epsilon_{\tau\tau}^\oplus - \epsilon_{\mu\mu}^\oplus$, where the first three are complex and the last two are real. This approach is mostly independent of the underlying model and mediator mass ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).

[DeepCore](deepcore.md) is most sensitive to $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}^\oplus$, but can constrain all effective NSI parameters ([source](https://pos.sissa.it/398/245/pdf)).
